3D mapping of the Thickness by Bi1+

In ToF-SIMS analysis, it has been shown that the substrate signal (Si+ in our case) is exponentially dependent of the material thickness over the substrate [1]. Therefore, to effectively measure the thickness on of thin films, an image of the substrate signal Si+ can be obtained using Bi1 + primary ions (Fig. 1A). Using a calibration (Fig. 1B) conducted the molecule reference samples of known thickness (ellipsometry or other technique), these Si+ ion images can transformed in 3D maps of the deposited thickness. The example shown figure 1 illustrates the 3D map thickness of a lysozyme layer on silicon.

Since the construction of these 3D maps from Si+ ion images is not straightforward and involves several parameters and data processing, 2 platforms were developped. These platforms that were developed (Thickness By Bi1) allow to load the analysis images, perform smoothing, calibration, normalization and manage the thickness mapping in a user friendly way. Two verion are available. One is in python (pyTBB1) and the other one in MATLAB (AppTBB1).

Download and use the platforms.

Firslty download all the files. Indeed TBB1.png is an illustrative image and icon.ico is the icon of the platform. If these files are not in the same folder as the python and MATLAB script, you will have an error message.

# TBB1 introduction
3D mapping of the thin film thickness using Bi<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>  beam (Thickness By Bi1)

Measuring thin film thicknesses of a few nanometers is not always easy. In ToF-SIMS analysis, it has been shown that the substrate signal (Si<sup>+</sup> in our case) is exponentially dependent of the material thickness over the substrate [1]. Indeed, using a Bi<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> analysis beam, it is possible to construct a calibration curve relating the substrate Si<sup>+</sup> signal to the thickness of the thin film (Fig. 1A, measured by ellipsometry). Once the calibration is performed, an Si<sup>+</sup> ion signal image of the sample surface can be recorded (Fig. 1B) and a 3D map of the film thickness above the substrate can be created (Fig. 1C). The example in Figure 1 illustrates the 3D map thickness of a lysozyme layer on silicon.

Since the construction of these 3D maps from Si<sup>+</sup> ion counts images is not straightforward and involves several parameters and data processing, two platforms were developed. These platforms (TBB1 stands for Thickness By Bi1), allow to load the raw substrate intensity image, perform normalization, transform the Si<sup>+</sup> intensity into protein thickness using the calibration, and offer a multitude of options to display the resulting thickness maps in a user-friendly way, as shown in Figure 1C. Two versions are available; one is in python (pyTBB1) and the other one in MATLAB (AppTBB1).

Accordingly, the purpose of these platforms is to build up 3D thickness map of films from the underneath substrate ion image obtain by ToF-SIMS (Bi<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>).

# Download and use the pyTBB1.

Steps to take before using it:
    
1) First, download all the files and save them in the same folder. "TBB1.png" is an illustrative image and "icon.ico" is the icon of the platform. If these files are not in the same folder as the python script, you will get an error message. 
    
2) Redefine your file_path in the function pushLoadImage1 (line 449) and pushLoadImage2 (line 504). So when you load your images, the correct folder location is opened.
    
3) Make sure you have all the necessary python libraries. Otherwise you have to install them. For example, scipy package is not always available directly in all versions.
    
4) Update the molecular library with your coefficients and molecules (line 330 to 341). If you are not familiar with trees construction in python, you can enter new coefficients directly in the GUI using the check box (but they will not be saved for the next use).
    
5) If you have problems loading images, try using the most suitable format for the images: .png.

Figure 2 shows the python platform. It is constructed in three containers: 
- Loading and smoothing
- Calculator
- Plot


First you load the images (they will appear below). You load the Si<sup>+</sup> ion image and you can also load the total ion intensity image. The latter will be used to normalize the Si<sup>+</sup> count intensity in order to be independent of the Bi<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> current (from one measurement to another the current may change). Then you can smooth the 3D plot and the result will be shown. To smooth you use the slider that range from 3 to 100. A 2D convolution is applied (for more information you have a query button next to the slider).

Then you enter several analysis parameters (there is a query button next to each one to have explanation about these parameters). After you have to click on conversion button. The pixels length and pixel intensities will be converted in Counts and mm.
Subsequently you select a molecule in the library or you enter new coefficients (corresponding to the exponetial calibration; Counts = a.exp(-b.Thickness))
If you do a mistake or forget something, an error message will guide you.

Finally, you can plot the final 3D map with the "plot" button. You can decide if you want to apply the calibration and the normalization (with the checkboxes). If you don't normalize by the total intensity, keep in mind that the Si<sup>+</sup> intensity will vary with the Bi<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> current. You can also choose the colormap of the final plot.

# Download and use the AppTBB1.

Steps to take before using it:
    
1) First download all the files. "calibration library.xlsx" are my calibration data. You can update this file to use your own calibration.

2) The platform opens directly. You have to change the folder path and use the path were your images are. If you want to edit the application, enter >> appdesigner in the command and open the file AppTBB1.mlapp in the application designer.

Figure 3 shows the MATLAB platform. It is constructed in three containers: 
- Loading and smoothing
- Calculator
- Plot

First you load the Si<sup>+</sup> image. The format must be in Tiff and you must write the file name (and the file must be in the folder path). Then you can choose to load the whole image or to crop it. The image will appear in the preliminary view. You can smooth the image with the slider just below the preview.

Then you enter several analysis parameters (there is a query button to have explanations about these parameters). If you want normalize you have to enter the name of the total intensity image and click on "load" button. Subsequently you select a molecule in the library or you enter new coefficients (corresponding to the exponential calibration; Counts = a.exp(-b.Thickness)). You can update the molecular library by changing the values in the "function TreeSelectionChanged(app, event)" line 314.
There is also a button "show calibration curve" to plot the calibration of the selected molecule. You can update the related excel folder "calibration library.xlsx" and the "function ShowcalibrationcurveButtonPushed(app, event)" line 343.

Finally, you can plot a preview of the final 3D map with the "3D map preview" button. You can decide if you want to apply the calibration and the normalization (with the checkboxes). After that, you choose the color of the colormap and generate the final 3D map.
